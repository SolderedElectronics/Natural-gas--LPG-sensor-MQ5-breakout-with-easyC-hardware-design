Is your office located near a high traffic area? Are you concerned about the presence of natural and liquefied petroleum gases in your work environment? The MQ series sensors can help detect various gases, and the MQ5 sensor is an easy-to-use sensor that provides information about the levels of natural gases and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) in your surroundings. It quickly detects gas particles in the range of 200 to 10,000 ppm.

The breakout board provides digital and analog information through the easyC system. Sensor readings are obtained through easyC.



Product usage tips:


When gas is detected, the LED will start glowing. It will remain off if it doesn't detect anything. Four mounting holes enable easy mounting to surfaces. The board comes with three male headers.
